'''
explanation:
- user-selected point within triangle taken
- random vertex chosen, point halfway between current point and vertex found
- repeat previous step n times

thoughts
- yes, i do think its surprising that the next point in the soln set is halfway to a random vertex and that with more steps, you get a sierpinski triangle
- i have no idea why this works
- if y'all know hmu
